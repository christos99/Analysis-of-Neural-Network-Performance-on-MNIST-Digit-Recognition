# Exploring Neural Networks for MNIST Digit Recognition

This project focuses on exploring different neural network architectures for the task of MNIST digit recognition. The MNIST dataset consists of a large collection of handwritten digits (0-9), making it a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Keras

## Programming Language
Python

## Description
In this project, we utilize the MNIST dataset and implement various neural network models using the Keras framework. The goal is to train the models to accurately classify handwritten digits. We experiment with different architectures, varying the number of neurons in the hidden layers and exploring different activation functions.

The project starts by preparing the MNIST data, including loading and reshaping the images. We then convert the pixel values to a suitable format for training the neural network. Next, we create and compile the neural network models using sequential layers, including dense layers for learning complex patterns.

We train the models using the training data and evaluate their performance on the test data. We analyze the accuracy and loss metrics during the training process and visualize the results using graphs. By comparing the performance of different models, we gain insights into the impact of varying the neural network architecture on the accuracy of digit recognition.

This project provides a hands-on exploration of neural networks for image classification tasks, specifically focused on MNIST digit recognition. The code is implemented in Python using the Keras and TensorFlow frameworks, and the results are presented and visualized for analysis and comparison.
