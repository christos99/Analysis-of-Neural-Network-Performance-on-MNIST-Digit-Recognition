# Exploring Neural Networks for MNIST Digit Recognition

This project focuses on exploring different neural network architectures for the task of MNIST digit recognition. The MNIST dataset consists of a large collection of handwritten digits (0-9), making it a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Keras

## Programming Language
Python

## Description
In this project, we utilize the MNIST dataset and implement various neural network models using the Keras framework. The goal is to train the models to accurately classify handwritten digits. We experiment with different architectures, varying the number of neurons in the hidden layers and exploring different activation functions.

The project starts by preparing the MNIST data, including loading and reshaping the images. We then convert the pixel values to a suitable format for training the neural network. Next, we create and compile the neural network models using sequential layers, including dense layers for learning complex patterns.

We train the models using the training data and evaluate their performance on the test data. We analyze the accuracy and loss metrics during the training process and visualize the results using graphs. By comparing the performance of different models, we gain insights into the impact of varying the neural network architecture on the accuracy of digit recognition.

This project provides a hands-on exploration of neural networks for image classification tasks, specifically focused on MNIST digit recognition. The code is implemented in Python using the Keras and TensorFlow frameworks, and the results are presented and visualized for analysis and comparison.

# Neural Network Model Creation

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple neural network model using the Keras library and its application on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to classify hand-drawn digits into their respective categories (0-9).

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `model_builder_loop.py`: The looped script for creating and evaluating the neural network models.
- `model_builder_seq.py`: The sequential script for creating and evaluating the neural network models.
- `README.md`: This readme file providing an overview of the project.

## Model Creation

The `neural_network.py` script contains code for creating the neural network models using both sequential and looped form styles. Here's a brief description of each style:

- **Sequential Form**: The sequential form style is implemented for easy understanding of the code. Each model configuration is defined separately, trained, and evaluated. This style is suitable for creating and analyzing individual model variations.

- **Looped Form**: The looped form style provides a more efficient way to train and evaluate multiple model configurations. The model architectures are defined in a dictionary, and a loop is used to iterate through each configuration to train and evaluate the models. This style is suitable for experimenting with different model architectures.

## Model Architecture

The neural network models in this project have the following architecture:

- Input Layer: A flattened layer with 784 (28x28) neurons to represent the input image.
- Hidden Layer(s): Fully connected dense layers with customizable configurations, such as the number of neurons and activation function.
- Output Layer: A dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The models are trained on the MNIST dataset, which is split into a training set and a testing set. The training data is used to optimize the model's parameters, and the testing data is used to evaluate the model's performance.

During the training process, the model's performance is monitored using metrics such as accuracy. The training history is recorded, which includes the accuracy and loss values for each epoch.

After training, the models are evaluated on the testing set, and the performance is visualized using plots of accuracy and loss values over the training epochs.

## Customization

You can customize the model architecture and training parameters in the `neural_network.py` script to experiment with different configurations. Some of the customizable options include:

- Number of neurons in the hidden layer(s)
- Activation function(s) for the hidden layer(s)
- Activation function for the output layer
- Number of training epochs
- Batch size

Feel free to modify these parameters to explore different model variations and observe their effects on performance.
